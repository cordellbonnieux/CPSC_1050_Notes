Chapter 5 notes.

5.1
    CPU - Central Processing Unit.
    GHz - The measurement of the speed of the CPU.
        G = Giga (meaning one billion).
        Hz = hertz (Measures cycles per second, named after Heinrich R. Hertz).
        MHz = millions of hertz
    Clock - Centerally generated series of electical pulses. Used to ensure all actions of the computer are coordinated.
    Bus - ports that connect to external devices, like a USB port.
        FSB - front side bus, the main controller of all buses in the computer.
            Speed of FSB is also measured in MHz (GHz)
            Generally only accessed when the proccessors cannnot find what they need in the Cache (though they more than often do)
            The reason this is, is beacause the FSB is generally much slower than the processors.
    MB - Megabyte, 2^20 bytes. A single megabyte is a little more than one million bytes.
    Cache - Small amount of quick load memory. 
        Like when you load a webpage, your browser may cache the images and files for a later visit to load faster.
        The Chache in this case, is generally built into the processor chip.
        Allows the processors to have direct access to memory.

    Powers of 10 are used to express time (multiples of seconds).
    Powers of 2 are used to express storage (bits)

    Faster clock, FSB and more chache make a faster computer. Though a faster processor requires more power, and is prone to overheat.
    A faster FSB would only be of use if external devices ran as fast. 
    An as a Cache gets bigger, it's data becomes more cumbersome to access thus slowing down the processor(s).

    Display Area 
    HD - High Definition
    LED - Light emitting diode
        Last longer without going dim, and do not contain toxic metals.
    Screen Resolution - Measured in pixels (eg. Zpx x Ypx)


    GPU - Seperate chip, generally more powerful than the main processors.
        Games and other applications send information to the GPU, so it may quickly render images to the screen.
        Relieving the main processors of this task. Keeps the screen image data in it's own seperate memory.
        The more memory the GPU has the more complex images can be displayed and the more external screens can be used.
    RAM - Random Access Memory (Main Memory)
        Random Access means that each byte of memory can be accessed directly.
        1gb = 2^30, eg. 8gb = 8 x 2^30 
    DDR3 - An acronym which describes a type of memory created through clever circuitry which increased the rate that memory could operate at.
    HDD - Hard Drive Disk 
        Computer's secondary storage device, generally the largest.
    RPM - Revolutions Per Minute (like record speeds)
        Used to describe how fast the hard drive disk spins. 
        The faster the spin the higher the data transfer rate.
    SSD - Solid State Disk
        Used to replace the HDD.
        Rather than a disk, information is stored entirely electronically.
        The technology behind SSD is similar to Ram, though data is not lost when the power is off (because it has no moving parts).
    
    External Connections
    
    Disks (Bluray, DVD, CD etc)
    R - Writeable 
    RW - Re-writeable

    3D Camera - Means in addition to a standard 2D camera, it can calculate the distance between objects it's looking at.
    USB - Universal Serial Port 
    HDMI - High defenition Multimedia Interface 


5.2
    Von Neumann Architecture - The basis of all modern computers
        The principal idea that memory and instructions could be stored in the same location (eg. programs).
        The idea should probably be credited to J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly.

        Dr. Atanasoff and Clifford Berry created the ABC (Atanasoff-Berry Computer) in 1941, which was the first working digital computer.
            The first working computer was often acreditted to Eckert and Mauchly's ENIAC computer which was completed in 1945.

                            -------------------------
        - The memory unit holds both data and instructions
        - The logic unit performs arithmetic and logic operations on data
        - Input moves data from the outside world into the computer
        - The Output unit moves results from the computer to the outside world 
        - The control unit makes sure all units behave correctly

        ALU - Arithmetic logic unit 
            Capable of performing basic arithmetic operations. 
        Register - A small storage area in the CPU used to store intermediate values or special data.
      
        Control Unit - The organizing force, in charge of the fetch execute cycle.
            The Control Unit has two special registers; The instruction register (IR) and the program counter (PC)
            - Instruction Register - contains the instructions that are being executed.
            - Program Counter - contains the address of the next instruction to be executed.
            
        Input - the way we enter programs from the outside world into a computer.
            i.e. a keyboard and mouse or a scanner. The first Inputs were punchcards.
        Output - The way a computer's results are shown to the outside world.
            i.e. a monitor or printer

        Motherboard - where all components reside.

        The Fetch Execute Cycle

        Fetch - The PC (program counter) contains the address of the next instruction to be executed.
            The Control unit then goes to the address in the specified memory in the PC and copies it s contents.
            Then places the copy in the IR (instruction register). The IR now contains instructions to be executed.
            The PC now must be updated the get the next address of instructions to be executed.
            The Control unit increments the PC, and since the instructionss are stored contiguously the next adress of instructions will be put into the PC.
            It is possible that the PC may later be changed by he instruction being executed.
        Decode - Execute the instruction in the instruction register. The control unit will determine what that instruction is.
        Get - The instruction may require additional memory, this steps GETS that memory location.
        Execute - once the instruction is decoded and the data has been fetched the control unit is ready to execute the instruction.
            When this step is complete, the cycle repeats.


        ROM - ROM memory is built in memory that cannot be changed (the oposite of RAM).
            "burning" is adding the bit patterns to the ROM, which is done at the time of assembly or manufacture.
            ROM is used to store the instructions the computer itself needs to run.

        Secondary Storage Device - A storage device seperate from the main storage device, that can be written to.
            Saves the data when the power is off. Data can be added or removed from it.
            Also and input and output device. 
            Also known as "Mass Storage Devices"
        
        Seek Time - the time it takes for the read/write head on a hard disk to get positioned over the specified track.
        Latency - The time it takes for the specified sector to spin to the read/write head.
        Access Time - The time it takes for a block to start being read. The sum of seek time and latency.
        Transfer Rate - The rate at which the data moves from the disk to memory.
        Cylinder - The set of concentric tracks on all surfaces
