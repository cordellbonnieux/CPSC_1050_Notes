CPSC 1050 Class Notes

- Quiz Wednesday on lab2, chapter 3 - check d2l
- study boolean identity simplification, boolean algebra in general

This week: Continuing with Gates, circuits, truth tables and boolean expressions.
(Chapter 4)

Circuits <=> Boolean Expression <=> Truth Table 

Circuits to Truth Table

1. identify each row where the output is 1
2. for each row construct an AND that produces a 1 for the exact combination of input values for that row and a 0 for all others.
3. take all the OR of all expressions from the previous step. this would be a boolean expression with the given truth tabale
4. construct the circuit that corresponds to the boolean expression
