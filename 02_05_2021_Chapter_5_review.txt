Von Neuman Architecture
Components:
1. Input Device
2.CPU
    a. Control unit
    b. Arithmetic/Logic unit
3. Memory Unit 
4. Output Device 
- Instructions and data are both stored in the memory unit.
-The Processor units are seperate from storage units

Flow of Information
- Bus:
    - A communication system that transfers information (address,data and control) 
    between components inside a Von Neuman Machine (computer).
        component examples:
        a. Input Devices 
        b. CPU 
        c. Main memory (memory unit) 
        d. Output Devices
    - Bus width is the number of bits that it can transfer simultaneously. 

Input / Output Units
- Input Unit - A device through which data and programs from the 
    outside world enter the computer system. (eg. keyboard)
- Output Unit - A device through which results stored in the computer 
    memory are made available outside the computer system. (eg. screen)

Memory 
- A collection of cells, each with a unique physical address 
    Each cell will have a binary value with varrying number of bits
    for the address and for the contents. 
    The number of bits in each location (contents) is called
    the Memory's Addressability.
    The value of the address and contents are NOT related.
    The contents themselves could be used to represent anything,
    eg. an instruction, a signed-magnitude number, an ASCII character, part of an image or video etc..

RAM - Random Acess Memory
    - Memory in which each location can be accessed and changed.
ROM - Read Only Memory
    - Memory in which each location can be accssed but not changed.

RAM is volatile so data will be lost when the power is off.
ROM is not, so data is saved even when there is no power.

Cache Memory - Small amount of fast-access memory into which 
    copies of frequently used data is stored.
    Before a main memory access is made, the CPU checks whether the data 
    is stored in the cache memory.

CPU - Central Processing Unit (CPU)
    - Responsible for processing in a computer.
    - The CPU is made up of two parts:
        1. ALU ( Arithmetic / Logic Unit)
        2. Control Unit

ALU - Arithmetic / Logic Unit 
    - Performs basic arithmetic ooerations such as adding, subtracting,
        multiplying and dividing two numbers.
    - Performs logical operations such as AND, OR and NOT.
 "Most modern ALUs have a small amount of special storage units called Registers."
    -Registers 
        Can be accessed faster than main memory
        Hold special data and intermediate values 

Control Unit 
    - Ensures all other components are working
    - Has 3 special Registers:
        1. IR - Instruction Register
            Contains the instruction that is being executed.
        2. PC - Program Counter
            Contains the address of the next instruction to be executed.
        3. ACC - Accumulator 
            Stores the intermediate arithmetic and logic results.

The Fetch Execute Cycle
    - All the computer instructions relate to storing, retrieving and processing data.
    - The Proccessing Cycle Steps:
        1. Fetch - the next instruction.
        2. Decode - the instruction. 
        3. Get - data if needed or required by instruction. 
        4. Execute - the instruction.
    - To start the fetch-execute cycle the address of the first instruction 
        is loaded into the program counter (PC).
    
A closer look at the Fetch Execute Cycle
    1. Fetch the next instruction.
        a. The address of the instruction is in the PC. 
        b. Control unit goes to the above address in memory.
        c. Copies the instruction from that address to IR.
        d. PC stores the address of the NEXT instruction. 
        e. Control unit increments the PC. 
    2. Decode the instruction. 
        a. Control unit determines the instruction. 
        (The Instructions are built into the circuits of each machine) 
    3. Get data if needed. 
        a. Access data from the memory if needed. 
    4. Execute the instruction. 
        a. Control unit sends signals to the ALU to carry out the processing.
