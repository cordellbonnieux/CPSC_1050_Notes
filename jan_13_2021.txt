Quiz next Wednesday, on the material of Chapter 2 and Lab 1

When we convert from base 10 to base 2, we use the Quotient Remainder Algorithm

The book was translated to Latin by Fibonachi
    Before him roman numerals were used in europe
    He translated the Arabic book into Latin which uses positional numbers

ASCII
early computer table very old
how to represent the characters on the key board (ascii keys)
has decimal, hex, octal, html, Chr(what we see on the keys)
lowercase and uppercase have different values (think of camelCase!)
we will only focus on ascii table, not extended ascii table.

How to calculate 2's complement
take the positive representation, flip the bits and add 1
Negative integers are represented in 2's complement
We restrict ourselves to a Byte or 8 bits
The left most bit is a flag: 1 if the number is negative, 0 otherwise.
When we deal with 8 bits, we have to write with 8 bits (8 0s and 1s)

7 ---8 bits--> 0000 0111
take the positive, flip it,
step 1) -7 --8 bits--> 1000 0111 <- Is called sign-magnitude for -7
step 2) Flip magnitude bits 1 111 1000
step 3) Add 1            1
                    =======
                    1111 1001 <- 2's complement

taking a negative and adding it the same positive to get 0

    1111 111
    0000 0111 < -7
    1111 1001 < -7
    ===========
 (1) 0000 0000

sign  magnitude
The 1 falls off becasue there are only 8 bits in a byte, thus the answer is equal to zero.
In this case we never have to literally subtract, we add to subtract.
When we deal with 8 bits or 1 byte, any bit that gets 'pushed' pass the left of the 8 bits gets dropped.

to rediderrate
to get -7
we get positive 7 in binary: 0000 0111
we add a 1 at the start, that makes any number negative: 1 0000 0111 <- the 1 at the start is a sign, the rest of the number is the magnitude
then we flip the bits aka magnitude: 1 111 0000
then we add a 1 (2's complement): 1 111 0001
and 1111 0001 is the answer or 2's compelment.
2's complement removes the requirement to do subtraction, because a computer's circuitry can only add. this was to get by physical limitations.
