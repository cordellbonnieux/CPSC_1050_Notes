Chapter 9 - Object Oriented Design and High-Level Programming Languages

9.1 Object Oriented Methodology

    Object - An entity or thing that is relevant in the context of a problem.
    Object Class (Class) - A description of a group of objects with similar properties and behaviours.
    Fields - Named properties of a class. 
    Method - A named algorithm that defines one aspect of the behaviour of the class.

    Design Methodology 
    a. Brainstorming (what classes, functions etc)
    b. Filtering (reduce redundancies, merge classes or get rid of non essentials)
    c. Scenarios (assign responsibilities to classes)

    Encapsulation - Bundling data and actions so that the logical properties of data and actions are seperated from the implementation details.

    From the Text book:
    ""Grady Booch puts it this way:
    “Read the specification of the software you want to build. Underline
    the verbs if you are after procedural code, the nouns if you aim for an
    object-oriented program.” 2

    We propose that you circle the nouns and underline the verbs as a
    way to begin. The nouns become objects; the verbs become operations. In
    a top-down design, the verbs are the primary focus; in an object-oriented
    design, the nouns are the primary focus.""

9.2 Translation Process

    Compiler - A program that translates a high-lvel language program into machine code.
    Interpreter - A program that inputs a program in a high-level language and directs the computer to perform the actions specified in each statement. (like repl.it enviroment)

    Byecode - A standard machine language into which Java source code is compiled.

9.4 Functionality in High Level Languages

    Boolean Expression - A sequence of identifiers, separated by compatible operators, that evaluates to either true, or false.

    Data Typing:
    Strong Typing - Each variable is assigned a type, and only values of that type can be stored in the variable. 
    Data Type - A description of the set of values and the basic set of operations that can be applied to values of the type.

    Simple/Atomic Data Types:
    Integers 
    Reals
    Characters
    Boolean

    Strings - Composite data type, technically. But often considered Simple.

    Declaration - A statement that associates an identifier with a variable, an action, or some other entity within the language that can be given a name so that the programmer can refer to that item by name.
    Reserved Word - A word in a language that has special meaning; it cannot be used as an identifier.
