    Categories of Numbers

        - Natural Numbers : 0 and any number obtained by repeatedly adding one to it.

        - Negative Numbers : A value less than 0 (with a '-' sign).

        - Integers : A natural number OR a negative number.
        
        - Rational Numbers : An integer or quotient of two integers.
            eg. 33, -443, 1, 0, -1, 3/5, -22/56

        - Real Numbers 
            eg. 1, 2.45, -0.546




    Number Systems

        - Decimal : Base 10 / the 'normal' way to count.
            eg. 123 = 123_10 or (3x1) + (2x10) + (1x100)

        - Binary : Base 2
            eg. 123 =  123/2 = 61 r1    = 1111011_2
                       61/2 = 30 r1 
                       30/2 = 15 r0
                       15/2 = 7 r1
                       7/2 = 3 r1 
                       3/2 = 1 r1 
                       1/2 = 0 r1

        - Octal : Base 8
            eg. 123 = 123/8 = 15 r3 = 173_8
                      15/8 = 1 r7
                      1/8 = 0 r1

        - Hexadecimal : Base 16
            eg. 123 = 123/16 = 7 r11 = 7B_16
                      7/16 = 0 r7




    Positional Notation

        - Numbers are written using positional notation.

        - The value is represented as a polynomial in the base of the number system.

        - Polynomial is a sum of two or more algebraic terms, each of which consists of a constant 
            multiplied by one or more variables raised to a non-negative integral power.
            
            eg. 123 in base 10/decimal is 123_10 or (1x100) + (2x10) + (3x1)


    Positional Notation formula convers a number in any base to a decimal/base 10.

        123_8 in Octal to Decimal would be...
            1x8^2 = 64
            2x8^1 = 16
            3x8^0 =  3
                   ++++
                    83_10 in base 10/decimal
        
        123_16 in Hexadecimal to Decimal would be...
            1x16^2 = 256
            2x16^1 =  32
            3x16^0 =   3
                     ++++
                      291_10 in base 10/decimal  
        
        1111011_2 in Binary to Decimal would be...
            1x2^6 = 64
            1x2^5 = 32
            1x2^4 = 16
            1x2^3 =  8
            0x2^2 =  0
            1x2^1 =  2
            1x2^0 =  1
                   ++++
                   123_10 in base 10/decimal 

        


    Convert numbers in others bases to base 10:

        number example in anybase (B) [in this case 5 or above]

        eg. 1234323_B =     1xB^6 = a               
                            2xB^5 = b
                            3xB^4 = c
                            4xB^3 = d     Add all the results up
                            3xB^2 = e     to get the decimal number.
                            2xB^1 = f
                            3xB^0 = g 
                                   +++
                                   number_10
        
        We use the positional notation formula to convert from any base TO decimal.




    Convert decimal numbers/base 10 to numbers in other bases:

        Divide the decimal/base 10 number by the desired base, and write down the remainder. 
        Repeat this processes using the result of the previous division in place of the original number.
        After that, line up the remainders (not add) from bottom to top (bottom=left, top=right), and there's your new number.

        eg. 566_10 in BINARY/Base 2

            566/2 = 283 r0 
            283/2 = 141 r1 
            141/2 = 70 r1
            70/2 = 35 r0 
            35/2 = 17 r1 
            17/2 = 8 r1 
            8/2 = 4 r0 
            4/2 = 2 r0 
            2/2 = 1 r0 
            1/2 = 0 r1

        So, our binary number must be...

        1000110110_2


    Describe the relationship between basses 2, 8 and 16:

        They are all powers of 2 which makes it very easy to switch from the three using these shortcuts...

        Octal Number      2   4   7   5

                        000 000 000 000 -> Add up in groups of 3 for
                        421 421 421 421 -> Octal, working from right to left

        Binary Number   010 100 111 101
 
                         0101 0011 1101 -> Arrange the binary number in groups of 4
                         8421 8421 8421 -> starting from right to left.

        Hexadecimal         5    3   13(D)


    Explain the importance of bases that are powers of 2:

        Because of the shortcuts described above. Powers of 2 have a special relationship which makes it easier to convert between them.
