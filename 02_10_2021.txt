Abtract Data Type (material in Lab 6 / Chapter 8)

Stack - a stack is an abstract composite structure in which accesses are made at only one end.
    it's called LIFO: last in first out 
    items are removed or added much like using Undo (ctrl+Z)/ Redo in this program. or using back on the browser.

    PUSH - adding an item to a stack is called a push 
    POP - removing an item form a stack is called a pop 

Queues - A queue is an abstract structure in which items are entered at one end and removed from the other end.
    It is called FIFO: first in first out.
    like waiting in line at a bank.
    inseration is made at the rear of the queue and removals are made from the front of the queue.

    Enque - for insertation ie. Enque(myQueue, value)
    Dequeue - for deletion we use Dequeue(myQueue, value)

Binary Trees 
    A binary tree is an abstract structure in which each node is capable of hacing two successor nodes called children.
    The begining of the tree is a unique starting node called the root.
    A unique path (series of nodes) exists from the root to every other node.

    Binary Search Trees
        A binary search tree has the shape property of a binary tree. 
        A node in a binary search tree can have zero,one or two children.
        The value in any node is greater than the value in anynode in its left subtree and less than the value in any node in its right subtree.
        A tree is analogous to an unordered list.
        A binary search tree is like a sorted list.
        starts with the first number at the tree and organizes the other values branching off with smaller and larger values.
