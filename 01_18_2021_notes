0000 1101 ign magnitude of a positive integer
in decimal it is +13

-13 or -7 to 2's complement
These steps will give you 2's complement
step 1) write the sign magnitude 
step 2) flip the non-sign bits
step 3) add 1

We are given an 8 bit quantity and we are told that it is in 2's complement
How do we arrive at the decimal value?
We do the above three steps and it will take us to the sign magnitude:
Example. 1111 1011 is 2's complement. What decimal value does it represent.
step 1) flip the non sign bits 1 000 0100
step 2) add 1                  1 000 0101

Decimal place algorithm

23.58^10 in binary in up to 4 decimal places
23 -> 10111
.58x2 = 1.16
.16x2 = 0.32
.32x2 = 0.64
.64x2 = 1.28
= 10111.1001

Huffman Encoding

compression ratio = new size / old size (new size over old size)
- There is only one way to read a huffman encoding
- More used characters use less bits
- ASCII characters always use 8bits (a byte), but a Huffman encoded representation will use less than 'letter^8'.

Finish reading Chapter 3, and watch all the associate videos provided by the professor.
