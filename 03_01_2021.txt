Chapter 10 - Operating Systems

    CPU Scheduling
        - First come, first served.
        - Average turn around time - to find we draw a Gantt Chart. 
            ( x + y + z + w ) / 4 = average turn around time 
        
        Shortest Job Comes Next

        Round Robin
        - Each process runs for a specified time slice and moves from the running state to the readt state to await its next turn if not finished.
        - Time slice: The amount of time each process recieves before it returns to the ready state to allow another process to run.





Chapter 11 - File Systems and Directories

    Path - location of file or directory
    Relative Path - files or subdirectories that share a parent directory

    File types - The kind of information contained in a document.

    A disk drive is organized as a stack of platters where each platter is divided into tracks and sectors.


    - Seek time the time it takes for the disk area to be read by the laser.

    Disk Scheduling - request types.
    FCFS - first come, first serve
    SSTF - shortest seek time first. Goes to the closest number from where it currently is.
    SCAN - As soon as the request is under the head, it is processed in the direction it is moving. (the one that's used)
