Quiz Wed Feb 10 base on Lab 4.
Acedemic week 8 is midterm week. (2nd week back after spring break.)


Chapter 7 - Problem Solving and Algorithms.

    Data types
-A data type is classification of the type of data that a varibale can hold.
        i.e. integers, booleans, strings etc 
    Arrays
-A named homogeneous collection of items in which individual items are accessed by its index position within the collection.
    i.e. integer arrayName[SIZE] //size could be any Number.
-A Sorted Array makes the Array easier to Search!
   
   Binary Search
-In general if you have 'n' sorted items, it takes at most log_2(n) comparrisions to determine if an item is in the list or not.
-Binary search of n sorted items has log_2(n) complexity in the worst case (if item does not exist).

    Sequential Search
-In n items, even if they are sorted has complexity n in the worst case. (not as good)


    Bubble Sort 
-Add the first index pos to the last index pos, then divide that number by 2. 
    Repeat until the result is found.

    Quick Sort
-Use a pivot to partition the list into two parts.
-Click the step button to move low, high, or swap a small element at low with a large element at high.

-Quick sort on n random values, works in nlog(n) comparrisons.
-Select sort or Bubble sort, need n^2 comparrisons.
