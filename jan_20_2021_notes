Chapter 4 - Gates and Circuits
- You will need the applet for the relate lab.


Objectives
-Identify the basic gates and describe the behaviour of each
- Combine basic gates into Circuits
-Describe the behaviour of a gate or circuit using boolean expressions, truth tables, and logic diagrams

Boolean Expression <=> Truth Table <=> Circuit

-Six types of logic gates
1. NOT Gate
    - Accepts 1 signal
    - enters as 1, output is 0
    - Only takes a single input
    - What comes out is the negation of the input
    - it negates the signal- boolean expression X = A'
2. AND Gate
    - two input signals, A & B 
    - two input values, 4 output combinations
    - boolean expression = X = AB 
    - the output is also 0 unless the A & B are 1, then X (output) will be 1
3. OR Gate
    - Does the logically OR of two boolean values.
    - the only time you get 0 output, is if both inputs are 0
    - X = A+B
    - Two inputs
4. NAND Gate
    - 2 inputs
    - the negation of AND
    - boolean = X = (AB)'
    - output is always 1, unless both inputs are 1, the output is 0.
5. NOR Gate
    - the "not" of OR
    - X = (A + B)
6. XOR Gate
    - two inputs
    - X = A (+) B 

The difference between XOR and the OR gate is only one input situation
XOR excludes the two signals to both????

Gates with more inputs
- some gates can be generalized to accept three or more input values
- A three-input AND gate for example produces an output of 1 only if all input values are 1

Circuits- A combination of gates connected to perform more complex tasks
- Combination circuit
    - a combo of several circuits where X is the circuit combo
        output: x = D + E = AB + AC 

- Boolean Algebra
    -Commutative
    -Associative
    -Distributive
    -DeMorgan's Law
    -Complement-Idempotent
    -Identity
    -Boundedness
    -Involution
