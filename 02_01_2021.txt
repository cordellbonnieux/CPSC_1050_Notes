Pusedo Code and C++ intro

- Psuedo Code Terms used in 1050
    Get / Read / Input //prompt the user to enter a value or string
    Display/ Write/ Print/ Output // echo something to the screen
    Set // declare a variable or alter a variable
    - Psuedo Code Statements
        if(condition)
        else(condition)
        use indent/TAB in place of {}
        while (condition)

- C++ example function:

    Pusedo Code:
    Display "Enter two numbers"
    Input num1
    Input num2
    Set average to (num1 + num2) /2
    Display "Average of numbers= " + average

    C++ Code:
    in main() {
        cout << "Enter two numbers: " << end1;
        double num1, num2, average;
        cin >> num1 >> num2; // gets the numbers
        average = (num1 + num2) / 2.0;
        cout << "The average of the numbers is: " << average;
        return 0;
    }

Lab 4 Class Notes

1) Machine language (binary) - super simple cpu
2) Assembler language - super simple cpu
3) Psuedo code - notepad

- Fetch Execute Cycle
    Fetch
    Decode
    Get
    Execute

- Super Simple CPU
    (don't use TAB in Assembly language - it is very fickle.)
    Each location of memory in the SSCPU has 2 bytes (16 bits).
    First 4 bits are the opcodes
    Following 12 bits are either data, LDI, address of data for ADD, STO etc
    PC: contains the address of next to be executed
    ACC: 
    first four bits are opcode rest is operand (for assembler language).

    Assembly Language example:
    LDI 5  ;address 0 --put 5 into ACC
    ADD 4  ;address 1 -- add the value which is at address 4 to ACC
    STO 5  ;address 2 -- store ACC to address 5
    STP    ;address 3
    DAT 40 ;address 4
    DAT    ;address 5
    DAT    ;address 6

    Example:
    LOD 5  ; 0 --put the value at location 5 into ACC
    ADD 4  ; 1 --add what is at address 4 to ACC
    STO 6  ; 2 --store what is in ACC at location 6
    STP    ; 3 -- stop the program
    DAT 10 ; 4
    DAT 3  ; 5
    DAT    ; 6

    A better way of doing the above:
        LOD XX
        ADD YY
        STO ZZ
        STP 
    XX  DAT 10
    YY  DAT 3 
    ZZ  DAT
